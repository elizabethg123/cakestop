  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hi! I'm Jane Doe and I'm a photographer based in Provo, Utah. Now here's some filler text: Not only does this mean that inmates serve longer than they should have to but also that taxpayers must pay for their extended stays which may further decrease any savings that private prisons provide. Shane Bauer, a senior reporter for Mother Jones and recipient of many reporting awards, went undercover as a prison guard in a Louisiana CoreCivic prison. His experience there was consistent with the aforementioned statistics. </p>
  <p>Here's some more filler: This report concluded that to ensure contract prisons are safe and secure, the BOP should create a working group of experts to determine why the contract prisons had more incidences of the indicators checked in this report and take action if needed. They also recommended that the BOP ensures that inmates receive basic medical care, verifies that staffing levels and vital functions in contracts are followed, and reevaluates the checklist for reviewing private prisons to ensure that observation steps are clear and up to date (United States, Department of Justice).</p>
  <p>And one more: Whether or not private prisons provide a clear benefit over public prisons, they serve a purpose: they help reduce overcrowding in public prisons and are already in operation. As long as the state and federal governments monitor these prisons and ensure that inmates receive adequate medical care and are in safe and humane conditions, they should continue to use contract prisons.</p><br/></div>
